How do I tell the guy singing on the U8 that he‚Äôs a public health threat?
I guess on the bright side not being able to go minimizes my risk of getting COVID. Plus I‚Äôm still struggling to get my anxiety under control so this gives me one less thing to worry about.
  Vaccinated or not...you can still get and pass on Covid ... this is a fact. So why are YOU disrupting our supply chain causing so much anxiety among Canadians??

"Most cited reasons for NOT wanting to return to campus (this was a ""check all that apply question""): 1) COVID/health concerns for themselves - 76% 2) COVID/health concerns for others at home - 61% 3) General inconvenience (transportation etc.) - 58% 4) Social anxiety - 42%"
"While in undergrad because of covid,&amp; i don't know how to even get into a lab now. I know part of it is just that I have depression&amp;anxiety, but a huge part of it is environmental. I don't want to live in a place where all people care about is working &amp; people don't care about"

" Right - if I had to guess, I'd say - there's a decent chance that I would get Covid in the next year - let's say 10 - 20% chance.    What's my level of anxiety over that?    None.  Zip.  Zero.  Nada.  I figure it eventually happen, and I figure I'm well protected."

" Well, I'm not dealing with the same grief right now, but I think COVID anxiety/depression have a tie to food.   For me,  some days my diet is grasping at straws for any sense of control, other days it's reaching for comfort when I need to break from responsibility/stress."

" Frankly, legal care is more important than health care. Anxiety over legal entanglements can cause serious illness, on top of leading to #Covid. Thanks for post."
"    Sounds like every day of every week as my son described it up to Christmas. He was full of anxiety as the one child kept coughing (all day every day) for weeks at a time, as the kids came down with covid one by one"
I see huge anxiety and fear being created by  and  insisting that N95s are the only masks to use and that is wrong. Most of the millions of covid tests and thousands of covid patients were managed in medical masks

"Today's news for $MNMD is crucial because generalized anxiety disorder has huge potential as a treatment market.  1) Anxiety was only more recently recognized as a disorder, so the treatment market is less mature. 2) Thanks to Covid, GAD has been increasing exponentially. $MMED"

" That's the plan. This isn't the first time he's gone way off the grid, sometimes he works on ships. But COVID gives everything a frisson of anxiety. Like, he had a touch of food poisoning at the hotel, and we had to go through the ""is this COVID"" thought process."

 We have been seeing both Covid and nasty stomach virus circulating in schools here ‚Äî as well as the anxiety they produce. A difficult time for teaching and learning at all levels.
I'm thriving so hard right now. I'm in my prime. And tbh I would like to thank covid because the pandemic actually saved my life and made me realize my anxiety ain't shit!
 It makes sense given the fact getting covid could interfere with your surgery!! I hate anxiety and am so sorry you had to go through that.
